##What is the use of these files?
Everyone in college loves to play Counter Strike, and have hours of fun on the LAN with other hostel students.  
If you play Counter Strike on LAN or run a Half Life Dedicated Server (HLDS) and need to customize the gameplay options to work the best for you, you can use these files. The usage of these files is described below.

####buy.cfg  
Helps to assign your numpad to quickly purchase popular guns, ammo, armor, all at the press of a single button. This file is not for server, it's for client only.
####clan.cfg
Loads clan based configuration of Counter Strike v1.6 for clan and official matches with $800 starting money and 7s of freeze time.
####game.cfg
Loads a generic configuration of Counter Strike v1.6 for casual gameplay with $16000 starting money, no limitations on number of rounds and 0 seconds freeze time.
####msg.cfg
Is configurated to display message that the __GAME IS LIVE__ with a cool animation type effect. Always remember to execute this file on the server only, not on client, or animation will not render properly.

##How to use these files?
- Paste these files in the `cstrike` folder of your Counter Strike 1.6 installation directory. Something like  `C:\Program Files(x86)\Counter Strike 1.6\cstrike\`
- After starting the game open up the console by hitting `~` and type  
  ```
  exec clan.cfg
  ```  
  Use whatever is the name of file that you want to execute in place of `clan.cfg`
- Enjoy the Game !!
